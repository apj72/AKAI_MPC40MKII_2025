Akai APC40MKII CustomControlSurface for Ableton

A custom script for Ableton to control the Akai APC40MK2. Script originally created by Will Marshall which is no longer available on the internet. Ive updated it to Python3 so that it works with Ableton 11 onwards. I'm modifying it for fun to add additional functionality.
